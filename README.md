# Portfolio: Shader-based Image Manipulation Program
A play on a [similarly named piece of software](https://www.gimp.org/), this Godot 3.5.1 project intends to bring layered image editing to the Godot Engine platform, enabling cross compatibility beyond just PC platforms, as well as making use of the GPU hardware to perform calculations.

I was, indeed, successful in writing this piece of software with about 1 month worth of work. However, despite being the youngest of the projects I am uploading, I am the least proud of this one.
- The codebase is manageable, but with having to juggle multiple projects (B3313 on the side) and the little motivation I had, the code is somewhat rushed.
- Not something I was in control of, but Godot 3.5.1 has rather questionable mobile compatibility. In particular, Android applications have to launch a native file selection menu to get access to a single file from the file system. Godot is in no position to implement its own file browser here, however they did.

[Brawlforming](https://benedani.itch.io/brawlforming) is another Godot project of mine with significantly better UX (especially mobile). It is closed source though.

# About portfolio repositories
These repositories were meant to demonstrate how I write software, and to be able to say that I have a GitHub portfolio.

I plan to contribute to open source as well (in particular, eyeing a [certain Nintendo Switch emulator](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/) as well as Linux projects) - but financial stability has to come first. Without eggs, no chickens will be able to hatch.
